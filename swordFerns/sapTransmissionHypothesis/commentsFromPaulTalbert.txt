Are you doing the data analysis/statistical test?

In the paragraph about taking photos, would it be helpful to explicitly mention that you are taking
photos of both controls and experimentals? It might be a good idea to take photos of the plants that
you take the fronds from, in addition to the progress of the fronds in the experiment.

For the budget, you should at least include the cost of 18 Falcon tubes (Marianne should know, or I
can see what they cost in my lab), unless you think Parks will object to spending a few bucks. Even
with digital photos, there are probably a few costs of preparing a report, unless everything is
digital and done by volunteers. Is Marianne volunteering her time, or should you ask for some
compensation for her? Or are students volunteering their time?

Even if all labor is donated, it might be good to give an estimate of the time/value. This might
improve credibility and might be good for Lisa to be able to show to her bosses.

To following up on David and John's concerns about "crinkly fronds".
They are right to point out that this phenotype is ill-defined.

David tells us of reports from PNW fern expert Richie Steffans of healthy
wild sword fern populations with common crispate pinnae.

We do not yet know if this healthy phenotype exists at Seward Park.
My very casual observation is that "crinkly" preceeds necrosis, but
we definitely should not bank of this.   It -may- be that the die-off
begins with disrupted sap flow in the pinnae, and that - for pinnae
which previously lay flat - curling ensues. Then further disruption
leads to necrosis, first at the tip, sometimes covering an
entire single side of a frond, with the other side mostly healthy.

Some preliminary (or concurrent) study of the stages of dying of ferns
at Seward Park, or elsewhere, would be useful.  Is there a single
trajectory?  Several?  How often do we observe the crinkly phenotype
closely preceeding necrosis?

We have offers of assitance from two new volunteers, the result of
Tim's talk at the WNPS on January 3rd.  They may be willing to do some
detailed field tracking of the die-off trajectories.

This looks reasonable to me.  Sort of a more professional reproduction of your experiment.  I would
only say that one frond should be taken per fern.  You have a pseudo replication problem taking
multiple fronds from one individual.  Seems like the impact on Seward is minimal.  I would try to
assure Lisa about the purpose and what you hope to conclude, and that the results will be reported
on Verdant's system.  Hearing that durectly from Marianne will probably reassure Lisa.

I agree with all of the questions/comments raised by Paul [Talbert] below – especially with regards to
cost/time estimates.  I also wondered if there was any utility in tracking the “donor” plants
(repeat photographs or even more thorough monitoring of each plant – you could adapt Tim’s plot
monitoring protocols?).  I’m not certain this would necessarily be warranted, although it could be
useful to compare the greenhouse results with speed and/or severity of disease symptoms of donor
plants.

I would also recommend more clarity in the Sampling Methods section:

  1) How will you control for possible airborne disease organisms?

  2) How exactly will the fronds be suspended in the tubes? Are you going to rely on parafilm only
     or could you use some kind of septa cap?

  3) Will the affected and control frond stalks be physically touching in each tube? Will the frond
     pinnae of each pair be physically touching each other above the tube? Will this be consistent for
      all pairs?

  4) How will the 18 paired samples be positioned in the greenhouse? Will all pairs be in the same
     rack or will treatments be physically separated? Will controls be interspersed with treatment
     pairs?

# Observational Studies, Experiments, and Proposals Related to the Puget Sound Sword Fern Decline

In this repository we collect proposals and reports in progress - with long-term and official archives maintained by Seattle Parks (and perhaps others).

## RFP: perhaps now it the time to issue requests for research proposals?

Research and experimentation on the sword fern die-off has, over the last four years, been  rather unsystematic.  It has taken us a while to realize the nature and extent of the problem.  Seattle Parks, WSU, UW and citizen scientists have cobbled together some low levels of funding and lots of volunteer effort to run studies as they occur to us.  Seattle Parks ecologist Lisa Cieko has consistently supported the work, finding some funding for consultants and experimental restoration.  

A more systematic approach to research and remediation may now be worth a try.  
In the research circles in which I work - my day job is in computational biology at the Institute for Systems Biology - research strategies and priorities are typically set by a central funding agency.  For us, this is usually the NIH, which identifies topics of interest, circulates requests for proposals, then convenes study sections to review, critique and prioritize the submissions.

The central agencyâ€™s budget is usually not known in advance. Once the the annual budget is decided, the top-ranked proposals are funded, and the research begins.  In addition, if especially compelling proposals are received, addressing urgent problems,  these can motivate the search for increased funding.

For the sword fern decline, I propose a similar approach:

 - The sword fern working group (or a subcommittee) identifies  broad research topics.
 - RFPs are drafted and circulated, with full candor about the uncertainty of funding.  
 - Research proposals (with budget options) are submitted by prospective researchers.
 - The working group then sketches out various budget scenarios, on the assumption of finding zero, moderate or generous funding.  Funding sources are identified and approached.  
  - Proposals are scored and ranked and then awarded funding depending on merit and the actual funding available.
  
## Here are some research topics and projects for which RFPs could be issued:

- What are the causes of the die-off?
- What is the trajectory (or trajectories) from health through decline to death?
- How best to monitor die-off, at regional scale, and at the scale of selected small sites?
- Ongoing actual monitoring projects (based on 2)
- Determine the population structure (age distribution, mortality, natural replacement)  of healthy fern communities in order to establish a baseline against which to assess and understand the die-off.
- What happens after die-off?  In what circumstances does unassisted regeneration occur?  In what circumstances does it not?   This topic could include strictly observational studies and/or restoration experiments.
